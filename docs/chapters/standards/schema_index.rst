Overview of the NMDC Data Schema
================================

The NMDC has developed a normalized metadata
`schema <https://github.com/microbiomedata/nmdc-metadata>`__ (available
in the NMDC GitHub) for representing studies, samples, relationships
between samples, and associated data objects. The schema is organized
into object classes, which act as nodes. Each class has associated
slots, which are fields that contain metadata that describe the object.
For more in-depth information, full documentation of the NMDC schema can
be found
`here <https://microbiomedata.github.io/nmdc-metadata/#classes>`__.

For the NMDC pilot, a python
`toolkit <https://github.com/microbiomedata/nmdc-metadata>`__ for
generating NMDC-compliant JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) objects was
developed to create ETL (Extract-Transform-Load) software to ingest
metadata from the DOE User Facilities. Read more about the data in the
NMDC pilot `here <https://microbiomedata.org/data/>`__.
