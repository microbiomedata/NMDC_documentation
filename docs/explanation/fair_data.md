# FAIR data

### Making microbiome data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR).

The NMDC is committed to adhering to [FAIR Guiding Principles](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618) with regard to data management best practices. As part of this commitment, the NMDC has established the [FAIR Microbiome Implementation Network](https://www.go-fair.org/implementation-networks/overview/fair-microbiome/) (IN), a consortium interested in microbiome research that has agreed upon a set of objectives and common vision for implementing FAIR principles in the context of microbiome data science.

The FAIR Microbiome IN seeks to align and synergize the efforts of the NMDC with that of the [GO FAIR]( community, leveraging the [GO FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/) open and inclusive [ecosystem of Implementation Networks](https://www.go-fair.org/implementation-networks/overview/) for the microbiome research community (e.g., [Chemistry IN](https://www.go-fair.org/implementation-networks/overview/chemistryin/), [Metabolomics IN](https://www.go-fair.org/implementation-networks/overview/metabolomics/), Biodiversites INs). The purpose of the FAIR Microbiome IN is to work with microbiome research communities to:

* Formalize core and domain-specific microbiome ontologies that promote discovery and reuse, and
* Establish training on the NMDC data models that allow for broader dissemination of knowledge and compliance for both humans and machines.

The NMDC is working across research teams, funders, publishers, and societies/consortiums to provide training and community engagement on data standards, a key component to making data FAIR. For example, the NMDC is a registered database with [FAIRsharing](https://fairsharing.org/biodbcore-001563/), which provides journals with a curated source of recommended repositories. The NMDC is also a member of ORCID, and registered with the DOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI), which enables the NMDC to assign Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) to any data set submitted and processed through the NMDC workflows.

Additional FAIR-related efforts will be updated as the NMDC pilot continues to be developed.
