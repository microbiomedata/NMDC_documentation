# Downloading NMDC Data over Globus

The [Globus](https://globus.org) provides a mechanism to download NMDC data using high-bandwidth managed transfers. Globus has an automated point and click interface that lets you schedule a bulk transfer to your own machine or another compute center. For more information on using Globus to transfer data visit the [Globus documentation](https://www.globus.org/data-transfer).

## Globus Collections

NMDC collections are publicly visibly. You will just need a Globus login to access them.

### NERSC
To access NMDC data housed at NERSC please visit the ["NMDC" collection](https://app.globus.org/file-manager?origin_id=72dd396a-2242-11ec-a0a4-6b21ca6daf73&origin_path=%2F)

NMDC data are organized by NMDC identifiers. This collection serves up the same contents as https://data.microbiomedata.org/data/ so any file path underneath this can be mapped to the equivalent file in Globus. 


### EMSL
To access NMDC data housed at EMSL please visit the ["NMDC Bulk Data Cache" collection](https://app.globus.org/file-manager?origin_id=07de22e4-6c17-4bd2-86bc-49fe5ddb2070&origin_path=%2F)

NMDC data are organized by omics types. This collection serves up the same contents as https://nmdcdemo.emsl.pnnl.gov so any file path underneath this can be mapped to the equivalent file in Globus.
