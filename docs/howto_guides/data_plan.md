# Creating a Data Management Plan

### What is a Data Management Plan? 

A data management plan (DMP) is an integral part of grant applications. DMPs are required by every federal funder but the guidelines vary depending on the agency. Here you can find information for Federal Funding Agencies that work with microbiome data.  

Your DMP communicates how you and your team will collect, categorize, store, and share any data produced during the duration of a grant, and how that data will be preserved and made accessible after the completion of the project. While the DMP is important for your grant proposal, it is also important for laying the groundwork for producing high quality, accessible, and reusable data. A DMP should be a living document that sets expectations for your project team before and during the project. To maximize the impact of your DMP it should be public, machine readable, and openly licensed. 

While a new concept, making your DMP machine readable, increases the likelihood that your data will gain recognition and credit because your data can be located, reused and cited easily. To learn more about the merits of a machine readable DMPs read [Ten principles for machine-actionable data management plans.](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006750) 

### What to include in your DMP? 

While your DMP should include information about all data collected through the duration of your research, these guidelines and best practices focus on large omic data generated from microbiome samples. If you are unfamiliar with microbiome data management and metadata standards, we recommend you begin with an [Introduction to Metadata and Ontologies: Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Metadata and Ontologies (But Were Afraid to Ask)](https://microbiomedata.org/introduction-to-metadata-and-ontologies/) and the [NMDC Metadata Standards Documentation](https://nmdc-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/metadata/combined_schema_docs.html). These resources will introduce you to multi-omics metadata standards that leverage existing community-driven standards. 

### The NMDC DMPTool Template
In partnership with the University of California Curation Center of the California Digital Library, the NMDC team has created a microbiome-specific DMPTool Template. DMPTool is an open-source application that assists researchers in the creation of data management plans compliant with federal funding requirements. The NMDC DMPTool template is funding-organization agnostic and was developed to support microbiome data management best practices with specifications unique to microbiome standards and data processing. Once you [create an account at DMPTool](https://dmptool.org/), this link will take you to the [NMDC Microbiome Omics Research DMP Template](https://dmptool.org/plans?plan%5Bfunder%5D%5Bid%5D=%7B+%22id%22%3A+4265%2C+%22name[…]Microbiome+Data+Collaborative%22+%7D&plan%5Btemplate_id%5D=1321) ***which provides step-by-step prompts for your DMP.***

All of the sections below are laid out in the NMDC DMPTool template. This is a living document and the NMDC team welcomes community feedback on this resource. 

***Sample and Data Types and Sources:*** This section outlines what kinds of data will be produced throughout the project. 

* Describe the data set including basic identification information, average size, volume of estimated number of data files produced
* What types of data are being generated? 
* How are they being generated (tools and instruments)? 
* What analysis stages will the data go through? 
* Will you be using existing data for any of your findings?

***Data Standards and Formats:*** This section defines all variables of interest and communicates that you are aware of and will abide by community best practices whenever possible. 

* How is your data being processed? 
* What are the recognized community standards for your data and which will you follow? 
* How will your data adhere to FAIR Data Principles?
* Who will ensure that the data standards and formats are maintained? 
* How will you define and categorize variables of interest that are not part of standard fields? List all variables of interest.

***Roles and Responsibilities:*** This section shows how your data management plan will be executed and ensures that your team’s data management responsibilities are clearly defined. 

* Who is responsible for data storage and access, quality control, documentation, and preservation during the project?
* Who is responsible for coordinating the various data once collection is complete? 
* What is your estimated budget for data management activities? 

***Data Dissemination & Archiving:*** This section describes what the final data products will be and how you will protect data, if applicable. 

* What are the anticipated data products? Include secondary products (publications, presentations etc.)  
* When will your data be released? 
* Who is the target audience for your data set? 
* Is the security of your data important for privacy reasons? If so, how do you intend to protect your data?  

***Policies for data sharing, public access, and re-use:*** This section communicates that you understand your funders data sharing policies and that you have a plan to ensure public availability. 

* How will you comply with your funders data policies? Most federal funders require the public availability of all data produced. 
* What are your data attribution standards for other researchers who may use your data? 
* Are there any inherent restrictions on the sharing of the data? 

***Data and Sample Preservation:*** This section communicates the sustainability plan for your data, showing your funder that the data products will last after the completion of the project. 

* Who is responsible for maintaining the data and metadata over time? 
* How much of your budget (if any) will be dedicated to data maintenance and preservation?
* How much storage do you anticipate needing for your final data products? 
* How will you ensure adherence to plan your DMP?
